Make chia pudding with milk (dairy or non-dairy), vanilla, and a touch of sweetener. Top it with fresh fruit or berries.\n**Baked apples:** Baked apples are a classic healthy dessert that's easy to customize. Core an apple and stuff it with a mixture of chopped nuts, raisins, and a sprinkle of cinnamon for a warm and satisfying treat.
