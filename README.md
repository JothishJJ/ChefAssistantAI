The project is made with Htmx and GO.

To setup the local dev server. First make sure to have `go` with version `1.22` or higher.

Make sure to Fork this project and then clone this repo

```bash 
git clone <this-repo>
```

If you have [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) installed, make sure you are in the project folder and start server by running this command

```bash
npm run tailwind # Have to re-run after tailwindcss changes 
air
```

If you're not using air, you can just run it using GO

```

Don't forget to run it again after changes

From there you can go to `localhost:8080` to listen to the server
